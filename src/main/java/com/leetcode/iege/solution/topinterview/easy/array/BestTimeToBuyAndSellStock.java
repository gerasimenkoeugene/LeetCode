/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 *              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
